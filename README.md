# CRUD Application for managing GSoC 2023 data using Golang

Implemented a basic CRUD API: (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Golang that allows a user to manage a list of items (in this case, data regarding GSoC 2023). The API includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items. 

This app can be accessed using [Task Two](https://tasktwo.fly.dev/).
