# Task-3
## Go Application to Parse a CSV file

Implemented a basic web app that reads a CSV file and parses its contents into a data structure (in this case, a slice of structs). The program then outputs the data in a formatted way (as a table).

This app can be accessed using [Task Three](https://taskthree.fly.dev/).
